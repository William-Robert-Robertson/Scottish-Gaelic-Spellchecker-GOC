# Scottish Gaelic Spellchecker - GOC
Scottish Gaelic Spellchecker - GOC (Gaelic Orthographic Convention)

This includes the [hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/) spell checker file [glan-goc.txt](glan-goc.txt) and a mirror of the LibreOffice spell checker extension [hunspell-gd.3.5.oxt](hunspell-gd.3.5.oxt) to check spelling using the GOC (Gaelic Orthographic Convention) orthography of Scottish Gaelic.

To spell check using both traditional orthography and GOC orthography please use the universal spell checker [https://github.com/William-Robert-Robertson/Scottish-Gaelic-Spellchecker-Universal](https://github.com/William-Robert-Robertson/Scottish-Gaelic-Spellchecker-Universal)

The spell checker is based on the lexical database behind [www.faclair.com](https://www.faclair.com), has over 80'000 headwords and is able to check over 2.8 million conjugates.

The spell checker is provided as a LibreOffice extension with more detailed instructions for use here:
